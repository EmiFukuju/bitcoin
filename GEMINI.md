# GEMINI.md: AI-Assisted Portfolio Tracker Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a portfolio tracking website for stocks and cryptocurrencies, built collaboratively with an AI assistant (Gemini). The primary goal is to practice and document the process of AI-driven development.

## 2. Development Guidelines

### 2.1. Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** React.js
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Language:** JavaScript
*   **Styling:** Bootstrap 5
*   **Code Formatting:** Prettier

### 2.2. Coding Style & Conventions

*   **Formatting:** All code will be formatted using Prettier with its default settings to ensure consistency.
*   **Component Structure:** Functional components with hooks are preferred over class components.
*   **Naming:**
    *   Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PortfolioChart.js`)
    *   Functions/Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateReturn`)
*   **Imports:** Organize imports at the top of the file, with third-party libraries first, followed by local components and assets.

## 3. AI Collaboration Workflow

This project will be developed through a series of natural language prompts to the AI. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Initial Setup:** The AI will set up the project structure, necessary files, and initial dependencies based on these guidelines.
2.  **Feature Development:** Features will be requested via prompts (e.g., "Create a component to add a new asset to the portfolio"). The AI will generate the necessary code.
3.  **Bug Fixes:** Bugs will be reported in natural language (e.g., "The total portfolio value is not updating correctly"). The AI will analyze the issue and provide a fix.
4.  **Refactoring:** Code improvements will be requested via prompts (e.g., "Refactor the asset input form into a separate component").
5.  **Testing:** Test code generation will be requested as needed (e.g., "Write a unit test for the fee calculation function").

This document serves as the single source of truth for the project's technical direction and our collaborative process.
